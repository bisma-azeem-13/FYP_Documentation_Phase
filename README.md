# FYP_Documentation_Phase
# 📄 Final Year Project Documentation – FauxFace (Deepfake Detection System)

Welcome to the official documentation hub of my Final Year Project – **FauxFace**: a Real-Time Deepfake Detection System for Video Streaming Platforms.  

This repo contains my project’s two major deliverables from the early phases:  
✅ **System Requirements Specification (SRS)**  
✅ **Design Document**

---

## 🧠 Project Description

**Title:** Real-Time Deepfake Detection for Video Streaming Platforms  
**Category:** AI Web Application / Machine Learning  

In an age where deepfakes are evolving faster than fact-checkers, my project aims to fight fire with fire – or rather, deepfakes with deep learning 🔥

The system analyzes live or uploaded videos and detects deepfake content using a combo of **CNN** and **LSTM** models. It’s built to work in real-time, flag manipulated frames, and even send live alerts – protecting digital identities and media trust across platforms like Zoom or any WebRTC-based service.

## 🧩 Key Functional Highlights

- 👤 User Authentication (JWT/OAuth)
- 📺 Real-Time Streaming & Video Upload
- 🧠 Deepfake Detection using Advance Deep Learning Models
- 📊 Detection Visualization & Confidence Scoring
- 🔒 Data Privacy & Secure Handling

---

## 🔧 Tech Stack

- **Backend:** Python (Django)
- **Frontend:** HTML, CSS, JavaScript
- **Deep Learning:** TensorFlow (for model training & deployment)
- **Libraries:** OpenCV, Haarcascade, Keras
- **Security:** JWT/OAuth

## 📁 Documents Included

- [`SRS Document`](https://github.com/bisma-azeem-13/FYP_Documentation_Phase/blob/main/Bisma_Azeem_FYP_SRS.pdf)  
  Lays out the system goals, functional requirements, and architecture plans.

- [`Design Document`](https://github.com/bisma-azeem-13/FYP_Documentation_Phase/blob/main/Bisma_Azeem_FYP_Design_Doc.pdf)  
  Details system design, data flow, component diagrams, and design decisions.

> *These documents formed the foundation for building, shifting, and iterating through my FYP journey. Not everything I wrote in these went exactly as planned—but every word taught me something valuable.*

## 🛠️ Next Steps

This repo is currently focused on **Documentation Phases**.  
Stay tuned for model training, system deployment, and more technical updates soon!
